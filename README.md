### Dependencies and browser support ###

Fortunately, md2bbc does not need any external library to work.
The tests may require to use QUnit.js, the testing library built for the jquery project.

Talking about browser support... John Fraser (the original developer of the library) [supported a lot of old browsers](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown/#browser-compatibility).  
We try to support them too, you can just try to run the [tests](http://alfateam123.github.io/md2bbc) and see it something becomes red.
